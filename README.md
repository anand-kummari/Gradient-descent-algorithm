# Gradient-descent-algorithm
    The python code implements incremental mode gradient descent algorithm.
The input file **trainingDataSet.txt** contains features and their labels,separated by spaces,for training the algorithm.

After competetion of training **testingDataSet.txt** is passed to the algorithm to predict what the labels might take for a given input feature and creates a new file named **testingDataPredicted.txt** which stores the labels.
